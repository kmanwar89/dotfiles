### Summary
Dotfiles and other configuration files for i3wm installation on Dell Inspiron 15-5547 Laptop (on metal) running Arch Linux

[Wiki](wiki) will eventually be populated and include detailed steps on how I set up my hardware, fixed various UI/UX issues, configured i3 for basic usage and "riced" my system.

### Setup
arch_install.sh - used to install base Arch system with some tweaks specific to my Laptop
link.sh - used to symlink all relevant dotfiles between the ~/dotfiles directory and their relevant location. This way, I only ever make changes in ~/dotfiles, and everything stays organized and updated. Backing up is also every convenient
